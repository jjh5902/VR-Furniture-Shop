73 detailed prefabs ready to be dropped in to your scene. Meshes unwrapped specially for universal material use: choose a material, adjust color in color picker and texture look.
More than 40 textures with normal maps, and the demo scenes provided.


---
How to use:
1. Choose a prefab from "prefabs" folder.
2. Drop the prefab in to the scene.
3. Change the material color in the color picker if needed. If you are already using this material, you may want to make a duplicate and rename to avoid changing other objects color.
4. Adjust the texture tiling: a wall will require more tiling than a chair. 
5. Lightmap if needed. Prefabs are ready for lightmapping.

Note about lightmaps in demo scenes: the maps had been tweaked in some cases to uncompressed 512x512 pixels texture, please take that in to consideration when overwritting the lightmaps.
Note about prefabs lights: Lamps have lights, configured only for backed shadows (different to default config). Please make sure the light config fit your needs.
Note about textures and materials: The materials are just examples from the textures provided, feel free to mix different materials on a sigle object (e.i some sofas can hold up to 4 different materials).
Note about demo scene "furniture": If you want to rebake the lightmaps, you need to adjust "interior_light" prefabs material main color to white.
